\section*{Acknowledgement}

I would like to thank Prof.\,Dr.\,sc.\,techn. Essameddin Badreddin for his topic proposal and genuine interest in the topic, in addition to his initiative to help and discuss problems which occurred during the completion of this thesis. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Dipl.-Inf. Alexander Alexopoulos, who was always willing to help and recommend ideas for dealing with obstacles and suggestions for improvement. Last but not least, I would like to thank my father, mother and sister, who stood by me unreservedly during my whole Master's degree and without whose help I would not have been able to complete this degree successfully.
